## Description

This is a collection of games written in Python. It includes classic games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Magic 8 Ball, and Rock Paper Scissors. The project is designed for fun and also as an exercise in handling user input, conditionals, and basic game logic.

## Introduction

This project is a simple Python-based implementation of three interactive games:
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A classic 3x3 grid game where two players take turns to place their marks and try to get three of their marks in a row.
- **Magic 8 Ball**: Ask the Magic 8 Ball a question and receive a random answer from a predefined set of responses.
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: A game between the user and the computer, where rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

## Features

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**:
  - 2-player gameplay.
  - Check for winning conditions.
  - Board display after each move.
- **Magic 8 Ball**:
  - Random responses to user questions.
- **Rock Paper Scissors**:
  - User vs Computer gameplay.
  - Determine winner based on user’s choice and computer’s random selection.
